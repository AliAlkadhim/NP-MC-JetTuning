    "One simple example which is paradoxical is the following: suppose we have our usual likelihood \n",
    "$$L(\\theta, \\nu)= \\frac{e^{-(\\theta+\\nu)} (\\theta+\\nu)^N }{N !} \\ \\frac{e^{-\\nu} \\nu^M}{M !} \\tag{20} $$ and we observe $N=M=0$ so that the likelihood becomes $ L(\\theta, \\nu)= e^{-(\\theta+\\nu)} e^{-\\nu} $. Suppose that now we wish to make an inference on $\\theta$. It should make sense that if we know for a fact that there is no background events (since $M=0$), that the likelihood should not depend on the mean background (since there is no backround to begin with). [Feldman and Cousins](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9711021v2.pdf) were aware of this issue and assigned the problem to be the incorrect interpretation of the intervals as Bayesian intervals.\n",

    "A very closely related problem is the existence of a signal and background densities, say both depending on POI $\\theta$, and the likelihood will be given by\n",

    "where the likelihood $L(\\theta)$ is the probability for obtaining the observation $x$ from either a signal or background distribution, where $\\theta$ is an unknown proportion of signal (since real events come as a mixture of signal and background), and we would like to infer about the value of this parameter of interest. In the presense of nuissance parameter $\\nu$ the likelihood becomes\n",
